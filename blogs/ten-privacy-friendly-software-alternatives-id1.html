                        As the saying goes "there is no such thing as a free lunch", yet the opposite is what we've been led to believe when it comes to our software. Many of us use services that may seem free because we do not directly pay for them, but they must make money from somewhere. The truth is that most free software do this by exploiting personal data, often without consent or knowledge of the user. Many of the alternatives listed below are open source (meaning their source code is available online for anyone to verify) or have demonstrated a strong commitment to security and privacy. All of them are free, either supported by paid versions or maintained by volunteers. Here are my personal recommendations in no particular order:

                        <br>
                            Changing your default search engine is just about the easiest switch you can make. DuckDuckGo is a search engine with a mission to uphold user privacy and serve results free of bias and ad trackers. In addition to DuckDuckGo, Startpage is also a great alternative, delivering the exact same results as Google search but in privacy. These search engines make their money through advertising but do not serve "personalized/targeted" ads, attempt to identify you, or collect/sell your data.

                            ProtonMail and TutaNota both offer free options for secure email. Unlike other email providers, both of these email services emphasize user privacy and security. Utilizing end-to-end encryption, the services ensure that their parent companies cannot have direct access to your messages, and both of them offer the option to send encrypted emails to others. Both of these services' free options are supported by paid versions.

                        <br>
                        While it's by no means perfect, Mozilla is leagues ahead of other browser makers, championing user privacy and security as its core values. Its web browser, Firefox, received a great deal of upgrades in the past few years to adhere to that goal. While Chrome is popular, it sends loads of data back to Google and threatens the open nature of the internet due to its overwhelming market share. Firefox has the same security and flexibility while supporting a privacy-focused user experience. Mozilla, the parent company, funds Firefox through donations and "search royalties" (companies pay them to set their search engines as the default).

                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        Many people use ad blockers to filter out annoying ads on the internet. Not only do they block ads, but they also block many of the malicious trackers that come with ads. Ublock Origin (not to be confused with "Ublock") is feature rich and blocks ads indiscriminately, unlike AdBlock or AdBlock Plus, which have "acceptable ad" policies that let advertisers pay to unblock their ads. Ublock Origin is an open source project maintained by volunteers.

                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        Many people use VPNs to protect their browsing habits and get around content restrictions, but, ironically, many free VPNs spy on users in order to remain profitable. ProtonVPN funds its free servers using the revenue they earn from their paid servers. It's also based in Switzerland, which has strong privacy laws unlike the United States.

                        <br>
                        Signal is a great alternative to iMessage and text messaging. It's available on MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux, offering a secure way to message your friends and family. Most free messaging services are able to read the contents of your conversations. Signal uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that the contents of messages are encrypted from the moment they leave your device to the moment they arrive at the recipient's device. Signal offers the option send encrypted files, messages, and calls.

                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        Firefox send is a service run by Mozilla that allows users to send files privately over the web. Before sending, the files are encrypted, and users can optionally include a password or limit the number of times the files can be downloaded before expiring. The service generates a download link that can be easily sent to others, and all files are deleted from the internet after they have been sent. It's a great way to send friends and family full-quality photos, for instance, without concern that the files remain online.

                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        Perhaps the most effective thing people can do to improve their security online is to use a strong and unique password for every account they have. Many people reuse passwords, which is a convenient but bad practice. Password managers serve as the solution to generate and save passwords for users so that they need to remember only one strong master password. It's better to use a password manager than the default autofill services in web browsers since saving passwords in the browser is much less secure and doesn't sync passwords between different devices. Bitwarden is an open source password manager that has browser extensions and apps for nearly all mobile and desktop devices.

                        Standard notes is a great app to jot down information and quick reminders. The free option offers plain text notes that are automatically encrypted and synced across devices. It's supported by a paid version that offers automatic encrypted backups, themes, and file attachments.

                        These aren't quite full alternatives since there really is nothing equivalent to YouTube. However, these services allow users to access YouTube while avoiding many of its tracking algorithms. Invidio.us is a website which fetches videos from YouTube and displays the video content to the visitor. YouTube links can be converted into Invidious links simply replacing "youtube.com" with "invidio.us" in the link. NewPipe is a similar service but is more polished and in the form of an Android app available from their website (unfortunately, there is no iOS version). Both Invidious and NewPipe support subscription lists without the need to log in to YouTube. Another application, FreeTube, is similar to NewPipe but is a desktop app available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
